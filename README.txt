If your going to run everything, run win-registry FIRST as it makes the registry back to default.

You may also want to use system_file_checker to see whats wrong with your system.

I need some testers as virtualization is not working and having trouble on my laptop!

All the - scripts have a uninstall and a sc delete. If you get a error, it probably means you can't delete it because it is a system feature or it is not there.

Remember to run the program as administrator.

I am not responsible for any mess up you do on a system. Almost all of these scripts aren't tested yet and are constantly being updated. Use at your risk!

Good Luck

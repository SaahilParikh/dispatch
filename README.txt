Testers are currently DrDavid101 and Goerick (me). Anymore testers are welcome!

Remember to use a virtual machine when testing this. Bugs are still rampant and alot of refining is needed. 
Make sure to restart the machine in order for the tweaks and changes to be in place.

If you have a way to edit the MMC or gpedit via command line or powershell or anything automated let me know! 


To Do ATM:
Integrate the lgp folder into the framework and rename the folder as some of the edit is not in local group policy
